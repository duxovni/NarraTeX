%% This file sets up the Char, PC, NPC, and Name datatypes and creates
%% macros for each.  These are for characters in the game.  Here you
%% use the fields in Char to assign elements to each character.
%%
%%
%%
%% \MYname (and the player name) is parsed by \parsename, the command
%% provided by LaTeX/parsename.sty.  See that file and
%% Extras/README-namemappings for ways to take advantage of this.
%%
%%
%%
%% \MYsex is set to either \male, \female, \neuter, or \ambiguous, as
%% correct for the character.  \mfn{<masculine>}{<feminine>}{<neuter>}
%% will produce the correct form based on the current value of \MYsex
%% (\ambiguous will lead to <masculine>/<feminine>).  \mfn should only
%% be used within the scope of a Char macro.  \mf{<masc>}{<fem>} works
%% just like \mfn with the <neut> arg left blank.
%%
%% \pronoun{<command>}{<masc>}{<fem>}{<neut>} makes <command> a
%% wrapper around \mfn.  It is used to create a list of
%% gender-sensitive macros, mostly pronouns.  For example, given
%% \pronoun{\They}{He}{She}{It}, \cJamesBond{\They} will produce He.
%%
%%
%%
%% \badgetrue and \badgefalse toggle whether or not a Char macro will
%% produce a namebadge.
%%
%% \statstrue and \statsfalse will toggle the statcard.
%%
%% \skillstrue and \skillsfalse will toggle the skill list.  The skill
%% list prints both skills and stats (even if \statsfalse is set).
%%
%% \sheettrue and \sheetfalse will toggle the character sheet.
%%
%% \listtrue and \listfalse toggle whether the Char macro can display
%% in the playerlist.
%%
%% \labeltrue and \labelfalse toggle the box label.
%%
%%
%%
%% Some of the Char datatype's setup is in LaTeX/gametex.sty, to keep
%% this file short.

%% If a field is declared by \F, it must be given a value by \s inside
%% \NEW, even if it's blank.  If you want it to be optional, declare
%% it with \FD<field> {<default>} here.
%%
%% Use \newstat to create stats (below, in \PRESETS{Char}).  The
%% <default> value is used unless the given Char macro sets the field.
%% For example:
%%
%%   \newstat\MYhp	{Hit Points}{HP}{5}
%%
%% would give character a Hit Points stat, abbreviated HP, referenced
%% as the \MYhp field, that defaults to 5.
