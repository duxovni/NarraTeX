# NarraTeX

NarraTeX is a system for writing and compiling LARPS, based on Ken
Clary's GameTeX.  It exists because of a few personal itches that I
wanted to scratch, and because various friends wanted me to share my
patches with them.  GameTeX remains (c) Ken Clary and the MIT
Assassins' Guild; see the copyright notice in `GameTeX-README`.

## Usage

The process of writing games in NarraTeX is mostly the same as in
GameTeX; for details on using GameTeX, see `GameTeX-README` and the
`README` files in the various subdirectories.  This README will focus
on what has been changed from GameTeX.
