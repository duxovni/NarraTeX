\postscript/README

This is a directory for postscript files, encapsulated postscript
(.eps, .epsi) files, dvips headers, and other thing generally related
to postscript itself.

The duplex dvips header file is copied right out of the newtex locker.
simplex is also copied from there, though it's not actually a
"standard" dvips header file.
